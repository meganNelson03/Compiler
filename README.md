<h1>Compiler Project</h1>
<p>Language: Java</p>

<p>Input: Pascal code</p>
<p>Output: Assembly instructions</p>

<p>
A compiler is a specialized tool that converts sets of instructions into machine-readable code, the lower-level format that computers use to execute programs. This compiler takes high level Pascal code as input and returns assembly instructions.

<p>
The string input is first tokenized, or broken up into the smallest possible chunks of meaning, before it is syntactically analyzed for proper structure. After the input is verified against the Pascal Grammar through parsing, the compiler performs context-sensitive analysis. Semantic analysis is used to check for illegal arguments, type declaration, proper variable references, proper use of conditional statements, and other contextual code features. Building a compiler creates a richer understanding of definite finite automatons, grammars, syntax trees, and code validation.
